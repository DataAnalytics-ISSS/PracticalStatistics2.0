    "A p-value of 0.906 means that 90.6% of the simulated differences are greater than the observed difference, suggesting that the observed difference is not unusual under the null hypothesis.This value is much higher than the commonly used Type I error rate of 0.05. The Type I error rate (α) is the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis. If the p-value is less than α, it would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant difference.\n",

    "> Conclusion:\n",
    "Since the p-value (0.906) is significantly larger than 0.05, it fails to reject the null hypothesis. This implies there is no strong evidence to conclude that the new page leads to more conversions than the old page. The difference observed in the conversion rates is likely due to random chance."

    "> It does not appear that country has an impact on conversion based on the data collected. The results show that neither the United States nor the United Kingdom has a statistically significant effect on conversion rates compared to the baseline group, which is Canada. The p-value for the UK is 0.0745, which is close to the threshold, suggesting that UK users might have a slightly higher conversion rate, but this result is not conclusive. The p-value for the US is 0.1295, indicating no significant difference in conversion behavior between US and Canadian users. Overall, we cannot conclude that country or page type has a meaningful impact on conversion rates based on this analysis."

    "> Statistical Conclusion:\n",
    "The results of the logistic regression model, which included interaction terms between page type and country, indicate that none of the variables have a statistically significant impact on conversion rates. The p-values for all variables, including the page type (ab_page), country (UK and US), and the interaction effects (ab_page_UK and ab_page_US), are all greater than the standard significance level of 0.05. As a result, we fail to reject the null hypothesis for each term. This means that neither the new page nor the country of the user (UK or US compared to Canada) has a statistically significant effect on conversion rates. Furthermore, the interaction between page type and country does not show any significant effects, suggesting that the conversion rates for the new page are not impacted by the user’s location.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Practical Conclusion:\n",
    "From a practical business perspective, the results suggest that implementing the new page would not lead to significant improvements in conversion rates, regardless of whether the user is from Canada, the UK, or the US. The interaction terms also indicate that there is no meaningful difference in how the new page performs across these different countries. Therefore, introducing the new page is unlikely to provide a conversion benefit, and the decision to change the page design should not be influenced by geographic considerations. Based on this analysis, keeping the current page may be the better option, as there is no evidence to suggest that the new page would outperform it in driving conversions."
